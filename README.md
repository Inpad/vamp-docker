# Vamp-docker

This repo contains a number of `Dockerfile` files and `docker-compose.yml` to help setup Vamp in 
different situations. They should run anywhere Docker runs, but most situations will probably be on your laptop. 
Probably a recent Macbook.

## Prerequisites

1. You should have Docker installed which, on a Macbook with OSX, means [Boot2Docker](http://boot2docker.io/) and its dependencies.
2. For Docker compositions, you should have [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. Luckily,
that's a two-liner:

        curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.1.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
3. Some patience, as some of the container are somewhat big due to Java dependencies.
4. You are most probably on Github. You should have git.

## Run it

If you have the prerequisites sorted, pick the thing you want to do...

### Run Vamp with a Mesos and Marathon cluster

    git clone https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-docker.git && cd vamp-docker/docker-compositions/vamp-marathon-mesos/ && docker-compose up    
*Note 1: grab a coffee while everything gets installed on the first run.*
*Note 2: This runs all of Vamp's components in one container. This is not ideal, but works fine for testing stuff out.*


### Build the all-in-one Vamp container, run it with an external Mesos/Marathon

    git clone https://github.com/magneticio/vamp-docker.git && docker build -t my_vamp_image vamp-docker/dockerfiles/vamp-all-in-one/    

With this image, you should provide the Marathon endpoint on startup by setting the `VAMP_MARATHON_URL` enviroment variable, like this:

    docker run -i -t -p 81:80 -p 8081:8080 -p 10002:10001 -p 8084:8083 -e VAMP_MARATHON_URL=http://10.143.22.49:8080 my_vamp_image

Not so secret tip: Set up a full Mesos/Marathon stack on Google Compute Engine or Digital Ocean really easily using 
these wizards at [Mesosphere.com](https://mesosphere.com/downloads/). After the wizard is finished, just copy & paste the 
Marathon endpoint...
